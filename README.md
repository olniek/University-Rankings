# University Rankings Analysis

## Project Summary

This project explores global university rankings, focusing on how research performance shapes rankings. Using CWUR (Center for World University Rankings) data from 2012-2016, the goal is to identify key factors influencing rankings and understand the role of research output in university performance.

## Key Questions

* What factors have the strongest impact on university rankings?
* How does research output (publications, influence, broad impact) correlate with ranking?
* Do universities with higher research performance consistently rank higher?
* How can universities improve their rankings by enhancing research?

## Project Structure

The analysis is structured into two components:

1. **Exploratory Analysis** and **Exploring Relationships** for understanding dataset trends and identifying correlations between factors.
2. **Geographical Analysis:** Mapping university rankings globally.

## Data & Tools

* **Dataset:** Covers world university rankings from 2012-2016, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings).
* **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, GeoPandas, Folium, JSON.
* **Visualization:** Tableau Public.
